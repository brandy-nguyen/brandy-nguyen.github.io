			<!--Brief Introduction-->
			<h2 class="demoheading"><span style="color:blue;">Brief</span> <span style="color:purple;">Introduction</span></h2>
			<p>
				<span class="contenttext">
				Hello, my name is <span class="gradienteffect">Brandy Nguyen</span> and I am <b>the creator of this website</b>. When I was originally introduced to the <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>, I thought nothing of it other than being used to create plain text documents that can be read on browsers.
				My younger self was oblivious to how <b>web pages are not only structured but they are also enhanced by deliberate styles</b> wielded by the developers.
				In the core aspect of HTML, the structures are just rectangles and boxes with information placed within them. It sounds simple and it actually is that simple.
				The magic that makes websites lively and eye-popping is in how the developer uses <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> to the best of their artistic vision.

			<!--Creating Websites From Scratch-->
			<h2 class="demoheading"><span style="color:darkcyan;">Creating</span> <span style="color:navy;">Websites</span> <span style="color:brown;">From</span> <span style="color:crimson;">Scratch</span></h2>
			<div style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/Notepad_plus_plus.png" alt="A piece of lined paper has its top right corner slightly folded and has a grassy green color on the bottom half of the paper. There is a cartoonish green chameleon whose white eyes bulge from the top of its head. 
			Its small thin appendages wrap around a wooden number 2 pencil while its long tail curves below it. There is a bigger pencil writing 'Notepad++' on the paper in a sans-serif font."/></div>
			<p>
				<span class="contenttext">
				During my time in class, I&apos;ve learned to create HTML documents <b>using a basic text editor</b> like Notepad while learning about HTML standard practices. I am able to comprehend and <b>explain the structure of my own website to you all</b> since I have poured my heart and soul into it.
				Anyone can copy and paste code but it takes knowledge of one&apos;s own craft to be able to create new webpages. I strive to meet <b>World Wide Web Consortium</b>&apos;s goals<b> of making the Web as accessible as possible for everyone</b>. 
				In doing so requires myself to <b>abide by the standards set in place by the W3C</b> to make sure that my own website renders in as much <b>quality</b> as possible.

			<!--Semantic Use Of Format & Styles-->
			<h2 class="demoheading"><span style="color:darkmagenta;">Semantic</span> <span style="color:darkblue;">Use</span> <span style="color:olive;">Of</span> <span style="color:darkorchid;">Format</span> <span style="color:indianred;">&amp;</span> <span style="color:#4682B4;">Styles</span></h2>
			<div style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/clipart.png" alt="A set of three objects are drawn on a white background. A cylindrical white tube of orange acryllic paint lies on the ground with a circular lid screwed on top. Next up the stack is a thin paintbrush with a long green-colored handle.
			The brown bristles curve to the top left. Finally, the last object is a wider paintbrush with a thin brown handle. The light brown bristles are arranged in a long,wide row on top of the large brush."/></div>
			<p>
				<span class="contenttext">
				I mentioned in my introduction about how <b>anyone can have the exact same content</b> in their webpage but <b>their styles make them unique</b> from others. I highly recommend checking out the <a class="text" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> to see <b>CSS being used to its full potential across multiple styles</b>.
				<b>Presentation matters as much as content</b> made for a target audience. However, web design is not simply placing glamorous colors to look pretty. Instead, it has a <b>semantic purpose</b> in <b>making the user experience enhanced and usable</b>. Notice how I placed my navigation structures near the top left so that users can spot them easily.
				You&apos;re most likely able to correctly determine the destinations of the navigation icons from their symbols. Even my color scheme is made to have a high contrast for people to see the content well. <b>Every style element here on my website is a choice made deliberately</b>.

			<!--Advocating For Accessibility-->
			<h2 class="demoheading"><span style="color:deeppink;">Advocating</span> <span style="color:grey;">For</span> <span style="color:dodgerblue;">Accessibility</span></h2>
			<div style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/accessibility.jpg" alt="A section of a thin, white keyboard is visible. Within the center are three square buttons colored in blue with a person bound in a wheelchair, an ear listening to sound waves, and a stick figure with a cane towards the ground respectively.
			Surrounding the blue buttons are various keyboard buttons with letters such as the letter 'A'. There symbols like hyphens and slashes as well as a button that says 'delete'."/></div>
			<p>
				<span class="contenttext">
				I aim to make my website to be <b>perceivable</b> by people, including those who are affected by blindness or color blindness. I am also aware that the <b>user's viewing experience
				varies</b> based on their <b>connection speeds</b>, <b>type of device</b>, <b>screen resolution</b>, <b>web browser</b>, and their <b>need for accessibility</b>. In fact, I desire to learn how to make my website more accessible because <b>I believe that everyone has the right to access knowledge</b> shared across the Internet.
				Once again, <b>I emphasize the importance of following the standards</b> of the W3C as they change to ensure that <b>me and my sites are up to date</b> with <b>modern conventions</b>. I know that as technology evolves, we must adapt but <b>we should still lend our support to those unable to keep up</b> or risk losing them.
